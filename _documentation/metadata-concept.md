Metadata are additional information about the tests. They represent a set of facultative xml elements used to facilitate the edition or the execution of the tests but they don't impact the test itself. Withh the help of the metadata you'll be able to define following information

* [description](../metadata-description)
* [ignore](../metadata-ignore)
* [not-implemented](../metadata-not-implemented)
* [edition (author and updates)](../metadata-edition)
* [categories](../metadata-category)
* [traits](../metadata-trait)
* [group of tests](../metadata-group)
